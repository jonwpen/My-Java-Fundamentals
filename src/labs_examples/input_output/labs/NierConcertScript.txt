Pod 042 (narration): Everything that lives is designed to end.
Pod 042 (narration): "They" are perpetually trapped ...
Pod 042 (narration): ... in a never-ending spiral of life and death.
Pod 042 (narration): Is this a curse?
Pod 042 (narration): Or some kind of punishment?
Pod 042 (narration): "They" often think about the god who blessed "them" with this cryptic puzzle ...
Pod 042 (narration): ... and wonder if "they'll" ever have the chance to kill him.
2B (narration): When I met him "that time" ...
2B (narration): it was during our mission to destroy the Goliath-class weapon.
9S: You're 2B, right?
9S: My name's 9S. I'm here to provide support.
2B (narration): The No.9 Type S model is a high-end model.
2B (narration): And it's because of that there's a constant danger of them coming into contact with confidential information.
2B (narration): That's why I've been tasked with the duty of eliminating him ...
2B (narration): Over ... and over ...
2B (narration): But ... he was different this time.
9S: Scanners like me mostly work alone. Scouting out enemy lines and all that?
9S: I don't usually get a partner. It's kind of fun!
2B (narration): I simply ignored him when he'd speak.
2B (narration): If I were to grow close to him, it'd only become more difficult to kill him.
2B (narration): Even so, he wouldn't stop trying to make conversation with me.
(9S speaks with a bright tone.)
9S: Say, 2B? Don't you think this white flower would look good on you?
2B: I have no need for it.
9S: Aw, are you sure?
2B: Attaching a plant to my hair would do nothing for my combat abilities. Rather, it would more likely cause maintenance failure.
9S: Hahah. Man, 2B, you're way too serious, you know that?
2B (narration): I made a promise with 9S in the past.
2B (narration): A promise that I'd continue to kill him, without fail.
2B (narration): The 9S from back then, and the 9S before me, are two different people.
2B (narration): That fact ... makes my chest tighten.
Pod 042: Pod 042 to YoRHa unit 2B.
Pod 042: Report: Detecting errors occurring within unit 2B's memory region, likely due to unstable psychological state. Proposal: Moderate rest should cause improvement.
2B (narration): I've already been aware of that for a long time ...
2B (narration): But ... the day I'm freed from this pain ... will be the day I die.
Pod 042: Mail notification received from Command.
2B (narration): I wonder if I was afraid.
2B (narration): Or perhaps I was wrong.
2B (narration): Even so, I continued on by his side, without even knowing the name of the emotion I'd been feeling.
