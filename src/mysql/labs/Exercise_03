*  MySQL Exercise 3:
*
*   Now that you have your air travel database all set up and populated, please demonstrate how to:
*
*       1.) Query all flights on a specific day
*       2.) Query all flights between two specific cities on a specific day
*       3.) Query all passengers on a specific flight between two specific cities today
*       4.) Query the flight information for a specific passenger on a specific flight
*       5.) Query the passenger information for a specific user on a specific flight yesterday
*       6.) Query the number of flights between two specific cities this week, month, and year
*       7.) Query the number of passengers that traveled between two specific cities today, this week, month and year
*       8.) Insert records for new flights between airports
*       9.) Insert records for new tickets and passengers on specific flights
*       10.) Update meal preference (or something similar) for a specific passenger on a specific flight
*       Bonus: Have some fun - get creative - what else can you do? Flex those SQL muscles and show us what
*           you've got! :)
